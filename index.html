        As a newcomer in the coding community, my interests are:

      <h3>About Ryan</h3>
      <p>Prior to joining Thinkful, I was studying to be an audio engineer 
        in the Mele program at Honolulu Community College in Hawaii. After taking a break from
        college during COVID, I had a newfound interest in the inner workings of websites and how 
        to build and style them to my own liking. I would browse e-commerce websites for hours, fascinated
        by the layout styles and functionality of each website, which made me want to build a website of
        my own.</p>

      <p>
        Outside of coding, I have a deep love and appreciation for music. I've been a musician since I was a child,
        playing various instruments such as the guitar, sax, and piano. I also produce my own music through Ableton (a popular 
        production software) and DJ as a hobby.
      </p>
